# Advent of Code 2020

This is my garbage attempt at following along with the [Advent of Code](https://adventofcode.com/2020) challenges for 2020, using Golang.


## To run the challenges:

- install golang 1.15 or later
- clone this repo
- `cd` into the root of the repo
- run `go run main.go <day> <part>`, where `<day>` is the day number, and `<part>` is which challenge number for that day.
  - e.g., to run challenge #2 for Day 1, you'd do `go run main.go 1 2`


## TODO:

- [x] ~~clean up the `main.go` stuff, and use the `flags` package (or similar) for parsing input~~
- [ ] finish all the challenges, obviously
- [ ] make things more betterer
